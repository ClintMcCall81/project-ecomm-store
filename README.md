<!-- I decided to refresh myself on grid based layouts as I feel they
    are alot more mangable when laying out content. I watched a few videos
    and decided on a layout as well as learnt how to organize content and 
    a lot better in a way that made sense to me, this was the result

    I had watched this tutorial and made note of the css grid fumctions. And had
    tried it along with him. After that I researched how the functions work and
    what they do so I knew what I was doing. After that I made my first iteration
    of the website. And after more research decided to change my website to something
    different. My final result was a mix of some tutorial help and personal thinking /
    experience. As soon as I understood how the CSS Grid Layout worked it became a lot
    easier to manage and orginize my content
    
    Grid Template Areas was something we didnt touch in class but it was something I
    had found out during the tutorial that saved me a lot of time when placing and 
    resizing content. Especially during the media query stage, I couldnt decide whether
    I need change the template area or adjust the coloumns at 1fr. However i decided to
    go with grid-template-columns: 1fr; -->
